# MyStore
A custom app store that fetches app data from play.google.com

## TODO List:
- [x] Get app info from play store
- [x] Search app from play store
- [ ] Get apk from google play store servers
- [ ] Notify when new version of app is available

### Ideas
In order to get the apk from play store I'm figuring out how to use [android-market-api](https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-market-api/), which is depecrated. 
I'm going to see projects like [google-play-crawler](https://github.com/Akdeniz/google-play-crawler) and [googleplay-api](https://github.com/NoMore201/googleplay-api)
